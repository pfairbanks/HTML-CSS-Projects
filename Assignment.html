        <p>Happy Go Lucky Dog Training explains the importance of properly training your dog :</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://happygoluckydog.com/tips/appropriate-play/">Managing and training your dog can help prevent inappropriate play which can escalate into aggression.  Puppies first learn to play with their littermates. Their play consists of a lot of rough-and-tumble activity and tons of play biting. A dog playing in this fashion with an adult or child can be potentially dangerous. It is our responsibility to teach our dogs appropriate games they which can play with us.</blockquote>
